I PRAY THIS MESSAGE MAKES ITS WAY WELL TO YOU SOLDIER. IT IS NOT CLEAR FROM OUR END IF YOU HAVE ANY FRAGMENT OF LIFE REMAINING WITHIN YOU, BUT WE WILL HOLD ONTO HOPE.

I SUSPECT YOU HAVE BEEN PRESERVED BY YOUR SPACE SUIT FOR OVER TWO CENTURIES BY TIME THIS MESSAGE REACHES YOU. YOUR MISSION IS CRITICAL BUT YOUR TASK UNPREDICTABLE. DEEP INTO THE HEART OF THE ENEMY TERRITORY YOUR BODY PROPELLED IN THE LAST MOMENTS WE WITNESSED YOU. IT WAS A MIRACLE WE MADE IT OUT, BUT WE KNEW OUR TOP SOLDIER WAS NOW ASTRAY. WE SENT SOME OTHERS AFTER YOU, AND WITH THE ACCELERATION WE SET YOU ALL AT WE HAVE TO CALL THESE MISSIONS INTO THE FUTURE. BY TIME YOU ARE READING THIS MESSAGE I NO LONGER AM ALIVE, I WILL HAVE PASSED ON BY THEN. NONETHELESS, I HAVE FAITH IN HUMANITY WHEN FEW OTHERS DO. MAY GOD KEEP YOU.

-COMMANDER KHAN
